        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century. <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born Basel, Switzerland.
            There, he studied under another giant <br>of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. 
            In 1761 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
            Euler <br> was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers.
            His influence was felt in physics and <br> astronomy as well.
            Euler's work on mathematical anlysis, <i>Introduction in analysin infinitorum</i> 
            (1748) remained a standard textbook for well <br> over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessan he wrote <i>Lettres a me princess d'Allemagne</i>
            (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical <br> outline of the main physical theories of the time.
        </p>
        <p>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings.
            He is perhaps <br> best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula
        </p>
        <p>
            cos(x) + isin(x) = e<sup>(ix)</sup>
        </p>
        <p>de monstrates the relationship beween algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry.
            From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation
        </p>
        <p>
            e<sup>(&#8719<i>i</i>)</sup> + 1 = 0
        </p>
        <p>
            which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &#8719, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the anals of mathematics.
